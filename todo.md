# To-Do
~~- Set window size on load or set game elements to change based on screen size. Possibly used framed game?~~
    - Solution: Set div frame and use css to set size and centering.
    
- Add rotating colors on each point (change background image, paddle and ball colors)
    - Look at arrays? Sam's snake game uses this method, i think.
    
~~- Create a winner screen at 5 points? (look at winner screen example, figure out how to get the score and when they equal show screen. can't figure out how to check the score on each point. look into this.)~~
    - Solution: using the point function, it checks the score of the player who just got a point and runs that against the win screen if else.
    
- Create changing paddle color gameplay
    - 3 different paddle shades for each color set
    - Left and right arrows change color of player a paddle
    - When correct color, power serve the ball back? (think powerup)
    
~~- Change website title to Albers Pong!~~

~~- Make favicon for website~~

- Fix fuzzy text (google pixi hd or hd javascript text)

~~- Make paddles and ball bigger~~
